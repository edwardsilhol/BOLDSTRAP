            <h1>7 steps to success</h1>
        </div>

        <p>With the help of my friends from THNK, <strong>I've broken down the process of writing an email-based fundraising offer into simple steps</strong>. We're assuming that your friends are all over the world, and that you can't put together a physical event for your fundraiser.</p>
        <p><strong>If you can organize a real world event, then definitely do it!</strong> Here are some <a href="http://www.thefundraisingauthority.com/fundraising-basics/fundraising-event/" alt="Organizing a fundraising event">things to think about if you're going to do that</a>. The guidelines below will still help you, just turn your email into an invitation.</p>
        <p>Remember, this site is a work in progress, and it's certainly not perfect. Feel free to leave a comment below if you think you can help improve it!</p>

        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">1. A good story starts with a good title.</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>Write something <strong>short and inviting</strong>. "Now's the time!" is a good starting point. Remember you're writing to people you know well: they will open your email, so <strong>don't get too commercial yet</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">2. Get personal, and give an engaging story.</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>Keep it short, but <strong>we need a little context</strong>. Make it clear that you're asking for financial support, to jumpstart your project. Make it clear that you are very professional about it. <strong>Explain why</strong> you're doing what you're doing. What's your vision? Keep it short!.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">3. Time for a smart presentation of your business.</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>This is serious. It should be like an investor presentation. <strong>Short and to the point</strong>. What does your company do? How long have you been working on it? What have you done already? Who is in your team? Who are your partners? What are your key assets? What are your next milestones? Can we test your product?</p>
                <p>Twitter-style, <strong>one sentence answers are the best</strong>. Bulletpoints are cool too.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">4. How much do you need? How are you going to spend it?</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>So you need money, huh? Everybody needs money! State the exact amount you want to raise. What exactly is it going to be funding? Can we monitor the progress? <strong>Be as precise as possible</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">5. What's the deal?</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>This is the gist of it. <strong>Make an offer they can't refuse</strong>. Give options (3 to 5 options is good). People should be able to help you whatever their financial situation is. <strong>Don't commit to giving equity for small amounts</strong>. Instead, find fun ways to reward people for helping you: give them free accounts for their friends; Send a certificate, or a limited edition artwork; Put their name on your website; Commit to doing something really funny when you reach your goal, and send them the video!</p>
                <p>This part must be graphic, and <strong>call to action</strong>. Make a column for each option, and in a box clearly state the amount and the advantages. <strong>Make each box a link to a page that seals the deal</strong>.</p>
                <p>Note: the easiest way to transfer money is through Paypal. Set up an account for your fundraiser and go. Ideally, the option boxes should <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_pdn_xclick_techview_outside" alt="Set up Paypal button">prefill the amount on the Paypal page</a>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">6. Are there other things that would help you?</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>Yes, you need money. But maybe there's other things that can help: an introduction to a potential mentor, investor, or client; Advice on a specific topic; A free office; <strong>Think of simple things that can help</strong>. Things people can do by just writing an email, or sitting down with you for coffee. Focus on <strong>actionable items</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <div class="boxTitle">7. Let's wrap this up!</div>
            <div class="boxDescription">
                <p>When someone gets to this point, the least you can do is <strong>say thank you</strong> for taking to time to read through your proposal. Let them know you're happy to give more information if they want. Remind them that if they help you, <strong>your success will be their success too!</strong></p>

        <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
        <p>If you're an entrepreneur this word most likely has a special meaning to you. If you've met success, it revives a nostalgic memory of dreadfully painful yet somehow legendary moments. If you haven't met success yet, then it is a synonym for <strong>months, maybe even years of hard, unpaid labour</strong>.</p>

        <p>Bootstrapping is what you have to do until your beloved project reaches the level where the rest of the world becomes interested, <strong>until that magic moment when investors start calling you instead of you calling them</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Raising Love Money</h3>

        <p>If you've been bootstrapping for a while, been through a couple of incubators, met a bunch of angels and VCs, then you know too well that no one in the world will invest in your project until you've raised Love Money. Well who's this Love Money girl and why should you raise her?</p>

        <p>Having raised Love Money means that you've been able to convince your friends and family (the people who know you best) that what you're doing is damn serious and that you have the skills and determination to see it through. It also means that you've been smart enough to figure out a way to <strong>build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" alt="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</a></strong> and maybe even <strong>generate revenue</strong> (hint: try this one, it really helps) before knocking on every investor's door, which is the only way that you're not going to be wasting their and most importantly your time.</p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>

        <p>The problem with raising Love Money is the following: if you have to do it, it's likely that money is something you don't have a lot of. It may very well be the case that you're not good at all at making money. Entrepreneurs are visionaries, and visions don't sell too well on the market these days! Yet at the heart of every successful venture, there is a powerful vision.</p>

        <p>And here's the thing: <strong>if you don't have a lot of money, then money is probably associated to a lot of negative ideas in your head.</strong> It's probably a great source of stress. You might even see it as the one thing that stands between you and success.</p>

        <p>If you are a thinker and a visionary, and short term financial obligations stop you from achieving your dreams, this site is for you.</p>

        <h3>The solution</h3>

        <p><strong>This site is about attitude</strong>. I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.thnk.org" alt="THNK">THNK</a>, the Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership, and one of my classmates, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hajovanbeijma" alt="Hajo's profile on Linked In">Hajo</a>, showed me something I couldn't figure out alone: I think about money too seriously. I have a negative attitude towards it, and that attitude yields negative results. <strong>If I start thinking that money is easy, and fun, it will create a positive outcome</strong>.</p>

        <p>Concretely, Hajo told me to ask him for money. He believes in <a href="http://stample.co" alt="Stample">my project</a> and he wants to help. If it's money I need he'll give me money. And he doesn't care about the returns. We're not talking millions of dollars here, but rather a few hundred, and he knows that what comes around goes around. Besides, when my company goes public, in a few years, he'll have a VIP invitation to the celebration party.</p>

        <p>Hajo asked me to start a Love Money fundraiser, and assured me he'd be the first to contribute. I'm infinitely grateful for that: it got me thinking positively. <strong>How do you set up a Love Money fundraiser? How do you go about asking your friends and family for money, without making it awkward?</strong> I decided I'd figure it out for myself, beta test it with my THNK classmates and the THNK faculty, gather feedback, and share it with the world.</p>

        <h3>Stop bootstrapping, start boldstrapping!</h3>

        <p>Think about it: you're working like a horse to build a successful company. The people who help you today will be proud to say they invested in you. They'll be rich too. You're the one giving them a gift, really. Make an irresistible offer! Be funny! <strong>Be BOLD</strong>!</p>
