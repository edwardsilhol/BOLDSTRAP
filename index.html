        <p>With the help of my friends from THNK, <strong>I've broken down the process of writing an email-based fundraising offer into simple steps</strong>. We're assuming that your friends are all over the world, and that you can't put together a physical event for your fundraiser.</p>
        <p><strong>If you can organize a real world event, then definitely do it!</strong> Here are some <a href="http://www.thefundraisingauthority.com/fundraising-basics/fundraising-event/" alt="Organizing a fundraising event">things to think about if you're going to do that</a>. The guidelines below will still help you, just turn your email into an invitation.</p>

        <h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
        <p>If you're an entrepreneur this word most likely has a special meaning to you. If you've met success, it revives a nostalgic memory of dreadfully painful yet somehow legendary moments. If you haven't met success yet, then it is a synonym for <strong>months, maybe even years of hard, unpaid labour</strong>.</p>

        <p>Bootstrapping is what you have to do until your beloved project reaches the level where the rest of the world becomes interested, <strong>until that magic moment when investors start calling you instead of you calling them</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Raising Love Money</h3>

        <p>If you've been bootstrapping for a while, been through a couple of incubators, met a bunch of angels and VCs, then you know too well that no one in the world will invest in your project until you've raised Love Money. Well who's this Love Money girl and why should you raise her?</p>

        <p>Having raised Love Money means that you've been able to convince your friends and family (the people who know you best) that what you're doing is damn serious and that you have the skills and determination to see it through. It also means that you've been smart enough to figure out a way to <strong>build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" alt="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</a></strong> and maybe even <strong>generate revenue</strong> (hint: try this one, it really helps) before knocking on every investor's door, which is the only way that you're not going to be wasting their and most importantly your time.</p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>

        <p>The problem with raising Love Money is the following: if you have to do it, it's likely that money is something you don't have a lot of. It may very well be the case that you're not good at all at making money. Entrepreneurs are visionaries, and visions don't sell too well on the market these days! Yet at the heart of every successful venture, there is a powerful vision.</p>

        <p>And here's the thing: <strong>if you don't have a lot of money, then money is probably associated to a lot of negative ideas in your head.</strong> It's probably a great source of stress. You might even see it as the one thing that stands between you and success.</p>

        <p>If you are a thinker and a visionary, and short term financial obligations stop you from achieving your dreams, this site is for you.</p>

        <h3>The solution</h3>

        <p><strong>This site is about attitude</strong>. I'm currently enrolled at <a href="http://www.thnk.org" alt="THNK">THNK</a>, the Amsterdam School for Creative Leadership, and one of my classmates, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/hajovanbeijma" alt="Hajo's profile on Linked In">Hajo</a>, showed me something I couldn't figure out alone: I think about money too seriously. I have a negative attitude towards it, and that attitude yields negative results. <strong>If I start thinking that money is easy, and fun, it will create a positive outcome</strong>.</p>

        <p>Concretely, Hajo told me to ask him for money. He believes in <a href="http://stample.co" alt="Stample">my project</a> and he wants to help. If it's money I need he'll give me money. And he doesn't care about the returns. We're not talking millions of dollars here, but rather a few hundred, and he knows that what comes around goes around. Besides, when my company goes public, in a few years, he'll have a VIP invitation to the celebration party.</p>

        <p>Hajo asked me to start a Love Money fundraiser, and assured me he'd be the first to contribute. I'm infinitely grateful for that: it got me thinking positively. <strong>How do you set up a Love Money fundraiser? How do you go about asking your friends and family for money, without making it awkward?</strong> I decided I'd figure it out for myself, beta test it with my THNK classmates and the THNK faculty, gather feedback, and share it with the world.</p>

        <h3>Stop bootstrapping, start boldstrapping!</h3>

        <p>Think about it: you're working like a horse to build a successful company. The people who help you today will be proud to say they invested in you. They'll be rich too. You're the one giving them a gift, really. Make an irresistible offer! Be funny! <strong>Be BOLD</strong>!</p>
